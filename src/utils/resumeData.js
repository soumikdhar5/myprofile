    about: 'I am a seasoned Full Stack Lead and UI Architect with over 15 years of experience delivering scalable, cloud-native applications across global enterprise environments. Currently at Capgemini, I lead architecture and development initiatives for high-impact clients in sectors like energy and retail. My recent focus has been on React.js, Node.js, GraphQL, and Micro Frontend architectures, where Iâ€™ve guided cross-functional teams in modernizing legacy systems, improving code quality, and enhancing user experience.\nPreviously, I spent over a decade at Dell Technologies as a Senior IT Analyst, where I specialized in enterprise integration, building ETL tools, subscription models, and reusable API frameworks. My efforts contributed to a 25% reduction in incident resolution time and significantly improved delivery velocity through automation and process optimization.\nI thrive at the intersection of technology and leadership, with a passion for clean architecture, performance tuning, and DevOps adoption. I bring strong communication, stakeholder engagement, and mentoring skills, shaped by earlier roles in customer care and operations.',
